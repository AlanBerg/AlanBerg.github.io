> Best practices Generative AI dashboards

Interactive and content-generating dashboards are incrementally becoming the norm in education. However, many dashboard pilots do not survive the vigors of fuller deployment. This hands-on one-day workshop provides discussion on best practices for strengthening the Learning Analytics (LA) feedback cycle within interactive LLM dashboards. LA provides a safety net for the intervention triggered by the generative AI. We frame the conversation in terms of a Dutch experimental infrastructure. We review the already established work of the participants and in groups through a mockup session paper or based on live infrastructure. We define requirements, design practices, and conceptual processes that aid in strengthening the relationship between Generative AI as an intervention and the entire Learning Analytics feedback cycle. The workshop is based on the knowledge gathered from Npuls, a Dutch National digital transformation effort aimed at all adult education levels. Specifically, the team Learning Analytics Best and Worst Practices disseminates evolving practices. The audience provides feedback on currently available dashboards through a review process. Later, documentation of essential requirements is ready for further dissemination and improvement. The workshop thus stimulates and documents the evolution of best practices around the dance between LA and generative AI within an educational dashboard setting.
